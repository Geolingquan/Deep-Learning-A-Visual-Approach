    "\n",
    "This notebook is provided to help you work with Keras and TensorFlow. It accompanies the bonus chapters for my book. The code is in Python3, using the versions of libraries as of April 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I've included the output cells in this saved notebook, but Jupyter doesn't save the variables or data that were used to generate them. To recreate any cell's output, evaluate all the cells from the start up to that cell. A convenient way to experiment is to first choose \"Restart & Run All\" from the Kernel menu, so that everything's been defined and is up to date. Then you can experiment using the variables, data, functions, and other stuff defined in this notebook."

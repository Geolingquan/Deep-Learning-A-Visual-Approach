## About the figures

This repo gives you all the figures from my book, 
including the three [bonus chapters](https://github.com/blueberrymusic/Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach/tree/main/Bonus-Chapters),
for free, in high-resolution
PNG format. 
To help you search, there's a directory called `Thumbnails` which 
offers contact sheets of the figures, 20 per page.

All of these figures are released under the MIT license. This
means you're free to use them any way you like, as long as you keep the 
copyright associated with them somehow. Use them for your classes,
reports, papers, presentations, whatever you like!

You're not required to attribute me or the book if you use these images, 
but I'd appreciate it if you would. 

Some figures include photographs. Many of these are by me, and I've
given you permission to use them. All other
photos are from Wikiart, Wikimedia, or Pixabay. The book provides a citation
and URL to the source of each of these images. The first two sites state that
their images are in the public domain. All images selected from Pixabay are 
labeled as released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, and explicitly
state, "Free for commercial use. No attribution required."

## Have Fun!

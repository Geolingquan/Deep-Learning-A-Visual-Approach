**Bonus2** and **Bonus3** show how to use the *Keras* library (also in Python) to do deep learning.

## The Notebooks

You can find all the Jupyter notebooks for these bonus chapters in the main *Notebooks* repo one level up. They're i
n folders named (surprise!) *Bonus01-Scikit-Learn*, *Bonus02-KerasPart1*, and *Bonus02-Keras-Part2*.

## The Figures

You can find all the figures for these bonus chapters in the main *Figures* repo one level up. Each figure's name is
 prefixed with *Bonus1*, *Bonus2*, or *Bonus3* and numbered as in the chapters. As with all the figures in this book, you can use these figures as you like for any purpose. Attribution is nice, but not required.

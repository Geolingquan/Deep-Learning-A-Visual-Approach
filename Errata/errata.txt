This is the errata file for "Deep Learning: A Visual Approach" 
by Andrew Glassner, published by No Starch Press.

Figures and Jupyter notebooks are available for free from my GitHub repo:
https://github.com/blueberrymusic/Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach

When a figure or notebook is corrected, I put the new figure or notebook 
in the corresponding repo, so those repos always contain the most correct 
and up to date versions.

   Replace the sentence just before Figure 2-5, beginning "This graph shows 
   us..." with "This graph lets us find the probability of getting back a
   value within any given range, by adding up the area under the curve
   in that range."

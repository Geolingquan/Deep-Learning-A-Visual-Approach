Figure 2-5

   The curve is not properly normalized. A corrected version of the figure 
   is in 2-5.png in the Figures section of the repo, and the corrected code 
   is in notebook Chapter-02-Statistics.ipynb

   Replace the sentence just before Figure 2-5, beginning "This graph shows 
   us..." with "This graph lets us find the probability of getting back a
   value within any given range, by adding up the area under the curve
   in that range."

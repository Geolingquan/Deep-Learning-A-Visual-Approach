This is the errata file for "Deep Learning: A Visual Approach" 
by Andrew Glassner, published by No Starch Press.

Figures and Jupyter notebooks are available for free from my GitHub repo:
https://github.com/blueberrymusic/Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach

When a figure or notebook is corrected, I put the new figure or notebook 
in the corresponding repo, so those repos always contain the most correct 
and up to date versions.

Entries are attributed to the person who first reported the issue, or
everyone involved if it took a couple of tries to make a clear and
concise change.

   The curve is now properly normalized. 
   Changed y-axis label to probability density

   Replace the sentence just before Figure 2-5, beginning "This graph shows 
   us..." with "This graph lets us find the probability of getting back a
   value within any given range, by adding up the area under the curve
   in that range. Suppose we want to find the probability of finding a 
   car with, say, 0.45 units of oil. We don't just look up the value of
   the curve at 0.45. Instead, we imagine a little region around 0.45, 
   such as from 0.44 to 0.46, and we add up the area under the curve 
   in that region. This gives us the probability of getting back a value 
   between 0.44 and 0.46. This means that the curve can take on values 
   much greater than 1, as long as the curve is always positive, and the
   total area beneath the entire curve adds up to 1."

This is the errata file for "Deep Learning: A Visual Approach" 
by Andrew Glassner, published by No Starch Press.

The up-to-date version of this file is maintained at
https://github.com/blueberrymusic/
           Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach/edit/main/Errata/errata.txt
           
This file is kept to plain text so that it can be most widely viewed.
The changes here address all errors I'm aware of, as well as omissions 
or places where the text or figures fell short of being as clear as I
intended.

Figures and Jupyter notebooks are available for free from my GitHub repo:
https://github.com/blueberrymusic/Deep-Learning-A-Visual-Approach

When a figure or notebook is corrected, I put the new figure or notebook 
in the corresponding repo, so those repos always contain the most correct 
and up to date versions. I won't normally update the thumbnails when I
correct an image, unless the new version is unrecognizable from the old.

Entries are attributed to the person who first reported the issue, or
everyone involved if it took a couple of tries to make a clear and
concise change.

These changes apply only to the second printing. All of the issues
we knew about in the first printing have been corected in the second
printing. You can check which printing you have by looking on the 
second page, opposite the dedication. The first printing errata can 
be found in this directory in the file first-printing-errata.txt.

## Errata

In a book of this size, inevitably a few errors will get past us. The repos for the notebooks and figures will always have the up-to-date, corrected versions. The `errata.txt` file here will document those corrections, as well as corrections to the text.

If you see an error that's not already reported, please write to me at `aquamusic@gmail.com` and let me know so I can fix it (and give you credit!).

## Have Fun!
